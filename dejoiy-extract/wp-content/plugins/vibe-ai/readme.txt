MCP server for WordPress. Connect Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor & other AI assistants to manage content, edit themes & automate your WordPress site.

== Description ==

Your WordPress site just became MCP-ready. [Vibe AI](https://wpvibe.ai/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteplugin) is the Model Context Protocol server for WordPress, connecting your self-hosted site to any AI assistant that speaks MCP: Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, Windsurf, OpenCode, and more. No copy-pasting between tabs. No switching between your AI chat and wp-admin. Tell your AI what you want, and it happens on your live WordPress site.

= The Model Context Protocol Server for WordPress =

Vibe AI is a complete MCP server implementation for WordPress. The Model Context Protocol, introduced by Anthropic and now adopted across the AI industry, lets AI assistants discover and call tools on connected services through a standard interface. Vibe AI packages every meaningful WordPress operation (content management, media uploads, theme file browsing, REST API access, and plugin abilities) as MCP tools your AI can call.

You install this free WordPress plugin, connect your site once, and every MCP-compatible AI client becomes a WordPress co-pilot. The Vibe AI WordPress MCP server handles authentication, encrypts credentials with AES-256-GCM, and relays your AI's tool calls to the WordPress REST API. Your WordPress site, your data, your choice of AI.

= Connect Claude to WordPress =

Vibe AI is the easiest way to connect Claude to WordPress. Use it with Claude Desktop, Claude on the web, or Claude Code in your terminal. Once connected, ask Claude to draft a blog post, schedule an article, reorganize categories, update site settings, or run any WordPress task through conversation. Claude sees your WordPress site through the MCP bridge and responds with direct action, not just suggestions.

Connecting Claude to WordPress takes about 30 seconds. Install Vibe AI, open the plugin admin, click to authorize, then add the MCP server URL to Claude's connectors. From that moment, Claude can manage WordPress content, search WordPress files, upload images, and interact with any WordPress plugin that exposes the Abilities API.

= Connect ChatGPT to WordPress =

Vibe AI is the ChatGPT WordPress plugin that actually connects the two systems instead of wrapping an API key. ChatGPT supports MCP servers directly in the web app and the desktop app, so once you add your Vibe AI MCP server URL, ChatGPT can read and write to your WordPress site through ordinary conversation.

Ask ChatGPT to turn a Google Doc into a WordPress blog post, find and tag every customer who downloaded a specific resource, update your About page in your own writing voice, or bulk-publish a content calendar. ChatGPT handles the language and strategy, Vibe AI handles the WordPress REST API calls behind the scenes.

= Connect Cursor, Windsurf, and Every MCP Client =

Vibe AI is not locked to a single AI vendor. Cursor, Windsurf, OpenCode, Claude Code, ChatGPT, Claude, and any other AI client that supports the Model Context Protocol can connect through the same MCP server URL. One WordPress MCP server, every AI assistant, no integration rewrite when you switch tools.

For developers, this means Cursor can edit your WordPress theme files with context-aware suggestions, Claude Code can run WordPress tasks as part of an agentic workflow, and Windsurf can scaffold new WordPress templates. For content creators and agencies, this means whichever AI writes best for your brand can publish directly to your WordPress site through the Vibe AI MCP bridge.

= AI-Powered WordPress Content Management via MCP =

Managing WordPress content through MCP has never been easier. Create blog posts, update pages, upload media, manage categories and tags, all through natural conversation with your AI assistant. Tell Claude to write a draft post about your latest product launch, ask ChatGPT to update your about page, or have Cursor reorganize your blog categories. Your AI assistant handles the WordPress REST API calls behind the MCP protocol, so you never have to touch wp-admin.

Vibe AI does not replace your AI assistant or lock you into a single provider. It works with every AI client that supports the Model Context Protocol, giving you the freedom to use Claude Desktop, ChatGPT, Cursor, Windsurf, OpenCode, or any future MCP-compatible AI tool for WordPress management.

= WordPress Abilities API Support for MCP =

WordPress 6.9 introduced the Abilities API, a powerful way for plugins to declare self-describing operations that AI assistants can discover and execute. Vibe AI fully supports this WordPress MCP integration. Your AI can discover what abilities your installed plugins expose, inspect their input schemas, and run them directly through natural conversation.

This means AI-powered WordPress plugin management works automatically over MCP. If a plugin registers abilities (WPForms, SeedProd, and others are adopting this standard), your AI assistant can interact with it without any custom integration. The WordPress Abilities API and Vibe AI together make every compatible plugin MCP-ready.

= Safely Edit WordPress Theme Files =

Vibe AI lets your MCP client browse and edit your WordPress theme files safely. Your AI can list files, search file contents, analyze code structure, and make edits through a draft theme workflow. The draft clones the active WordPress theme into a sandbox, makes changes there, and exposes a preview URL so you can see the results before going live. Your live WordPress site is never touched until you explicitly approve and publish.

Every file operation runs through WordPress capability checks, a path sandbox scoped to the draft theme, and PHP syntax validation before save. You keep the safety of wp-admin's file editing guardrails while giving your AI a real place to work.

= WordPress WP-CLI Commands over MCP =

Run WordPress administration commands through your MCP client. Activate plugins, switch themes, update options, flush caches, query the database, and more, all via native PHP dispatch with a security-first command allowlist. No shell access required, no dangerous commands exposed. Your AI gets a productive WordPress admin surface without the risks of raw command execution.

= Smart MCP Notifications on Your WordPress Admin =

Every change your AI makes over MCP triggers a smart notification in your browser. Edit a post and you will see a toast with a direct link to view or edit the updated content. The Vibe AI notification system knows whether you are in the WordPress admin dashboard or viewing the frontend and adapts the link accordingly, so your workflow is never disrupted while your AI is working in the background.

= One-Click WordPress MCP Authorization =

Connecting your WordPress site to an MCP server should take seconds, not half an afternoon. Vibe AI does away with application passwords you type by hand and API keys you copy between tabs. Provide your WordPress site URL, click the authorization link that appears in your WordPress admin, and approve the connection. Your WordPress credentials are encrypted with AES-256-GCM and stored securely on Cloudflare-hosted Vibe AI servers. One click, done.

= WordPress MCP Server for Every Use Case =

Whether you are a blogger managing content, a developer building WordPress themes, or an agency managing multiple client sites, Vibe AI makes AI-powered WordPress management accessible through whichever MCP client you already use.

<strong>Bloggers and Content Creators</strong> write and publish posts, manage media, organize categories and tags, and update WordPress site settings through conversation with Claude, ChatGPT, or any MCP assistant.

<strong>WordPress Developers and Designers</strong> browse theme files, analyze code structure, and edit WordPress themes using a safe draft-preview-publish workflow. Build classic WordPress themes from scratch with AI-powered design directly from Cursor, Claude Code, or your favorite MCP client.

<strong>Agencies and WordPress Site Managers</strong> connect client WordPress sites and manage content at scale. Use the WordPress Abilities API over MCP to interact with installed plugins. Automate routine WordPress tasks with whichever AI assistant fits the job.

= Third-Party Service =

This plugin connects to the Vibe AI service at [wpvibe.ai](https://wpvibe.ai) to relay requests between your AI assistant and your WordPress site over the Model Context Protocol. When you connect your site, a WordPress application password is created and encrypted with AES-256-GCM on Vibe AI servers hosted on Cloudflare. All communication between the plugin and the Vibe AI MCP service occurs over HTTPS.

No data is collected, tracked, or shared with third parties beyond what is necessary to relay your AI assistant's MCP requests to your WordPress REST API. Your content stays on your WordPress server.

= Built by SeedProd =

Vibe AI is built by the team behind [SeedProd](https://www.seedprod.com/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteplugin), the most popular WordPress landing page and theme builder plugin, trusted by over 1 million WordPress websites. We have been building WordPress tools since 2012 and know what WordPress site owners need from AI-powered management tools.

= Better Than Custom AI WordPress Integrations =

If you have tried connecting AI to your WordPress site before, you have probably dealt with custom API wrappers, writing fetch calls in Python scripts, hand-rolling a ChatGPT Custom GPT, or copying content back and forth between Claude and your browser. Vibe AI eliminates all of that friction with a proper MCP server for WordPress.

Unlike custom scripts or one-off WordPress AI integrations, Vibe AI uses the Model Context Protocol, an open standard supported by Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, Windsurf, and a growing list of AI tools. Connect your WordPress site once, use it with any MCP client. No vendor lock-in, no custom code to maintain for your AI WordPress workflow.

Unlike hosted AI WordPress services (AI Engine, GetGenie, Bertha, AI Power, WPCode AI, and similar bundled-AI plugins) that ship one model and one prompt style, Vibe AI lets you bring your own AI. Use whichever model reasons best for your task. Claude for long-form writing, ChatGPT for research, Cursor for theme editing, all connected through the same WordPress MCP server. Your data stays on your WordPress server. No third-party servers processing your WordPress content. Your WordPress site, your data, your control.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Which AI assistants work with Vibe AI? =

Any AI assistant that supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP): Claude Desktop, Claude on the web, Claude Code, ChatGPT, Cursor, Windsurf, OpenCode, and any future MCP-compatible client.

= Is Vibe AI a WordPress MCP server? =

Yes. Vibe AI is a full Model Context Protocol server implementation for WordPress. Your AI client connects to the Vibe AI MCP server, which relays authenticated requests to your WordPress REST API.

= Does this plugin modify my live WordPress site directly? =

For content management (posts, pages, media), changes go live immediately, just like editing in wp-admin. For theme editing, all changes happen in a sandboxed draft theme. The live site is never modified until you explicitly publish.

= What authentication does Vibe AI use? =

WordPress application passwords (built into WordPress 5.6+). Vibe AI uses a one-click authorization flow, so no passwords are typed into the AI chat. Credentials are encrypted with AES-256-GCM at rest.

= Is my WordPress data sent to third-party servers? =

No. Vibe AI connects your AI assistant directly to your WordPress REST API over MCP. Your content stays on your server. The only external connection is between your AI client and the Vibe AI MCP server, which proxies authenticated requests to your WordPress site.

= Can the AI break my WordPress site? =

Vibe AI has multiple safety layers: draft theme isolation for file editing, file extension allowlists, path sandboxing, PHP syntax validation, WordPress capability checks, and WP-CLI command allowlisting. DELETE operations move to trash (never permanent delete). New posts default to draft status.

= Do I need to know how to code to use Vibe AI? =

No. Vibe AI lets you manage your WordPress site entirely through conversation with your AI assistant. No coding required for content management. Theme editing is also conversational, your AI writes the code for your WordPress theme.

== Changelog ==

= 1.2.3 =
* Fix: Draft theme name no longer accumulates "(WPVibe Draft)" on every publish cycle — the suffix is now stripped on both create and publish, and the theme header cache is invalidated after restore. Thanks to J. Hoon Yu for the report.
